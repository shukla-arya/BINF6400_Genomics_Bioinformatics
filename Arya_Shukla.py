# There are 13 positions in the motif matrix, so the scoring is based on the subsequence that matches a motif consistent with the gene start. The values in the matrix are the position weight scores.

# The start codon is represented at positions 10, 11, and 12 in the motif matrix shown in the file. Out of the three options (ATG, TTG, and GTG), there is a T that appears in all of them. For that reason, we can eliminate positions 1-9, as they contain 0â€™s for the T nucleotide. The Shine Dalgarno motif occurs in bases A and G in positions 1-4.

# **Discussion**

# In this output, we can see the starting point of each ORF and how long each of them are. While there were ORF regions that exist with less than 60 base pairs (including the start codon but not the stop), they were excluded going forward. There are also ORF regions that are found within others in a nested format. For the purposes of our analysis, we considered all possible options because different start codons may take on various functions and are used for specific isoforms.
# <br>
# <br>
# The next step was to calculate the score where the start codon existed in positions 10-12 for the motif matrix. It is essential that the 13 base pair sequence has T in position 11. This is because its positional score in the motif matrix is not negative. For that reason, we take into consideration the 9 base pairs before the start codon and the 1 base pair after to account for all 13 positions used for calculation. It would NOT take into consideration the next 10 base pairs after the start codon nor would it consider the best group of 13 base pairs to produce the highest score.

# The motif represents the ribosomes ability to interact with the positions of the nucleotides getting fed into the ribosome. If it interacts well, then the tRNA will come in and recognize that spot. For the ribosome to have specific affinity, then the nucleotides must be an ATG or a GTG.

# Based on the criteria, we can deduce that a sequence with GTG will never produce a score of over 7.25 because the G in the motif matrix has a score of 0.5. Even though this is a valid start codon, we will not find any GTG ORFs in our output. Maybe we should reconsider the threshold of 7.25 going forward to determine if it is too high.

# There are also some contigs that result in 0 functional ORFs but some that result in multiple.
